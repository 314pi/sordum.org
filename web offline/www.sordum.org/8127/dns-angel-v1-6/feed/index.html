					<description><![CDATA[Please call the FBI of Miramar. Tell them the Judge made my abuser William Orlando Diaz take my children. I reported to them that he made threats to all my children to be Baker Act for many weeks. These incidents occurred at the same time with Michelle, Kelley Lau and Baker created a phony request of &quot; Fitness of Duty &quot;. William Orlando Diaz had physically hurt me many times and I provided evidence to the Family Court.  I also reported to 911 but these are the same cops who violated and abducted me ,keeping me against my will for over 5 days at Jackson Health Systems.  The M.D also cooperate and made phony diagnosis in order to create false records on my personality and integrity. My children are in great danger, I had a hearing schedule for March 8, I appeared  there and it was cancelled. No one in the court provided me any information. My name is DANIZE And We live at 16488 SW 47 terrace Miami, Fl 33185 for over 17 years. My three children are Satya, Daryn and Christopher Diaz. The courts are lying on purpose and are lying to my three children. Our Children are bi-racial , their grandmother is white European. I have never smoke or abuse drugs. I have never suffer from substance abuses. My phone is being block to reach the real agents . The FBI investigates abduction of children. Judge Ruiz -Cohen set it up with two adopted relatives who are bitter and envious of our children and me. I have work in the library of Miami Dade County steadily for over 20 years since 1990. I can be reached at 239-778-3855. I have never been a Booker in all my adult life. My employer started this mess by forcing me to accept phone calls at 9 am since June 2018.]]></description>
