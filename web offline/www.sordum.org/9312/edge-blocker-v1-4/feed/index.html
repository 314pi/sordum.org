					<description><![CDATA[Thank you, I took advantage of your kind offer. Deleting the application of course solves the problem. It seemed to me that the version of your EDGE Blocker application becomes more advantageous with the addition of the “Repair” and “Delete” items. Perhaps it’s still worth adding “Install” item for those who decide to return to using EDGE. I want to draw your attention to the fact that after applying the “fix” command, the application starts to appear in the process list as “ms_app.exe” instead of its original name.
 As I said, the removal of EDGE certainly solved the problem with downloading 158.3 mB (the size was always fixed) every time Windows was started (1 minute of launch). But it would still be interesting to solve this problem for users who decide only to “block” EDGE. This would be especially interesting for users who have limited connections.
 I am grateful for your help and timely response to the request.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The application is really very simple. I was looking for something similar. EDGE is really blocked from running.
 But there is one problem that Edge Blocker does not solve. This is every time when the system starts up, 158.3 MB is downloaded from the Internet. This information on network booting for EDGE is displayed in the Task Manager (application section).
 I also made an additional EDGE lock through the registry. But it did not help. I made another blocking via Firewall, but EDGE still continues to receive 158.3 MB from the Internet at the moment Windows is launched.
 Can you find a solution for this problem? Is it possible to additionally block through the hosts file? Please find a complete solution for blocking EDGE.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[EdgeBlock is not working for me; Win 10 Version 1803, Build 17134.471, 64 bit.
  I have the icon in my Toolbar, it pops up and responds when I click &quot;Block&quot;, but when I shut down and reboot, the default I set for Chrome is once more changed to Edge.
  All I&#039;m supposed to do is download and unzip the .zip file, right?]]></description>
