					<description><![CDATA[hello, when I start the application, it tells me there is no administrator crypted  account found.Create an administrator account and try again.etc...

How is it ? I am the only user and I always thought I was admin, even if recently something changed as some folders or actions ask me permissions or deny me authorizations to enter folders etc...

Now your app tell me to see users account and mine is under Administrator so what can I do ? should I change it to &#039;others=&#062; administrators group&#039; ?

thank you by advance]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[today, my win 10 pro has completed an update. After login, i always run a batch file. For the first time this app (1.0.0.0) ask me admin password but don&#039;t accept my administrator password. I switched to Administrator, enter the correct password but RunAS don&#039;t accept the password. I also tried 1.4.0.0. How can I fix/reset it? Thank you]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi,

I try to import settings through a script launched by GPO (startup machine, so with admin rights).
The script is working well when launched by user with admin rights (but not Administrator). It seems that the problem comes from UAC.
Am I missing something ?

Thanks a lot for this tool.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@Quantdox, just to explain.
The UAC was implemented for all those specialist, who use an administrator account for his daly work, but this is not recommended since computer exist. 
In most big environment the UAC is turned off, because an expert administrators know what he do and work only under his account to change some specific system settings.
The job of the UAC is only to protect administrators who know NOT what they do
I like this runas tools. You also find a list of all with comparison on &lt;a href=&quot;http://runas.eu&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Web Link ...&lt;/a&gt;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This application is heavily bugged &#038; it provides a great way to design exploits for any script kiddie or a nursery grade intruder. I suggest the software engineer to immediately stop hosting it.

Any sort of digital access should be under supervision. All OSes know this &#038; which is why they have designed UAC because an admin is required to provide unrestricted access to a limited user under his supervision &#038; no app can mitigate the unrestricted access problem. That&#039;s just almost impossible.

Simple Exploit 1:- First any application launched will display a UAC notification &#038; when clicked on &quot;change on how these notifications appear&quot;, one can change UAC settings which can&#039;t harm standard users much but will push back Win-10, 8, 7 admins to old XP days.

Simple Exploit 2:- If someone downgrades to older .NET Framework below v3.0 then it causes faulty code to execute messing up file system permissions. Many times a standard user can easily change system folders permissions by taking advantage of this. Although the intruder wouldn&#039;t know that when this faulty code executes itself.

Exploit 3:- Sometimes when a standard user clicks on &quot;Launch edit mode&quot; &#038; clicks on &quot;Manage user accounts&quot; from 3/10 times the standard user can remove admin account. This faulty code also executes randomly. Sometimes it happens other times it doesn&#039;t.

Simple Exploit 4:- 90% of programs easily provide application escape within their application. For example if a program requires admin privileges to be installed to a directory, the standard user when choosing a directory can easily right-click or shift+right-click anywhere &#038; click on &quot;Open command window here&quot; &#038; can open cmd.exe with admin privileges.

This isn&#039;t the fault of this software, it&#039;s the way Windows kernel is designed which is why it becomes an easy &#038; great platform for security intruders or what these people call as hackers.]]></description>
