					<description><![CDATA[The application is really very convenient and simple. It is very good that it is possible to add the entire folder to the whole blocking rule. In this regard, there is a wish to add the following in the new version:
group blocked in the list items (files) by program folders. This seems useful to me, since when you cancel a blocking rule in the list, it is difficult to select all the necessary files. It is also desirable that these folders have a program icon.
2) Add a blocking rule in the context menu (for ease of use):
a) block only incoming connections;
b) block outgoing connections only;
c) block incoming and outgoing connections (for this application);
d) unblock outgoing connections;
e) unblock incoming connections;
f) unblock all outgoing and incoming connections (for this application).]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;strong&gt;Inbound rules:&lt;/strong&gt; These are to do with other things accessing your computer. If you are running a Web Server on your computer then you will have to tell the Firewall that outsiders are allowed to connect to it.

&lt;strong&gt;Outbound rules:&lt;/strong&gt; These are so that you can let some programs use the Internet, and Block others.
