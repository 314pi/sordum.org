					<description><![CDATA[Good day!
Thank you for the great app!
  I have a question, maybe not quite in this topic.
 I have 2 applications. I want them to run along with the system (preferably without opening a window - right in the middle). You will say that it is easier to place from the startup folder and they will post it with the system. No, it does not work! I tried various startup options through the registry: with user rights: for all users, with the highest rights. I also tried to create bat, cmd and run using PowerR un. But nothing gives success. This works with all other applications, but not with SpeedFan and ReCrypt. These applications refuse to run from me in any version (only manually). I also played with the location of the application folders. Can you advise something?
I would like to have an application (maybe you will create one) that would allow you to regulate the launch of applications when the system boots. Yes, many applications on this topic. But there is no simple application that would allow 
1) to determine the launch to choose from: applications for the current user / all users; 
2) determine the sequence of launching applications (delayed by timer) to speed up the launch of the system;
3) application launch options: in tray, with active window.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi,
One month ago, I did a backup of my full registry.
Today, I tried to import that backup. No way to do this - not normally, not in Safe Mode. Not as Administrator... and not via your utility. Towards the end of the process, I get an error popup, saying in substance (I translate from Dutch): 
&quot;cannot import reg file: not all data are written to the registry. Some keys are used by the system or other processes or you are not authorized to execute this operation.&quot;
Is there a way to overcome this via powerrun and as a &quot;trusted installer&quot; ?
Or should I look to other possibilities.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[If that was true, then in ProcessExplorer, I would see the processes lauched by PowerRun as having the user: NT SERVICE\TrustedInstaller, but instead I see the processes launched by PowerRun having the user as: NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM.
This happens despite TrustedInstaller=1 in PowerRun.ini
