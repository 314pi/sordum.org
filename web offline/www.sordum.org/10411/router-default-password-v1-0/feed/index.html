					<description><![CDATA[f I just want to use a public Google DNS and it will not change the DNS, even if I change the IP to another country. Does this work? Or do I need further adjustments? I beg for the quick help of everyone. I am really miserable with the current DNS. I can not use any VPNs or change DNS. There is always a DNS address clinging to me. It is Malaysia or Singapore DNS. I can not delete it or change to another DNS. It only changed a few minutes later and returned. I connect to any country, when using whoer, IP2location is seen DNS Malaysia or Singapore. I really hate it. I hate it. Please help me remove it: &#039;(]]></description>
